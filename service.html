                        	A dropped ceiling is often a secondary ceiling, hung below the main (structural) ceiling. It may also be referred to as a drop ceiling, T-bar ceiling, false ceiling, or suspended ceiling, and is a staple of modern construction and architecture.
                 </p>
                 <p>The suspended ceiling was originally developed to conceal the underside of the floor above and to offer acoustic balance and control in a room. Advantage of a dropped ceiling is that the easily-removed ceiling panels offer instant access to the plenum, greatly simplifying repairs or alterations.Ceiling can be removed to access the wiring,plumbing etc.</p>

               <p>Aluminium Composite Panel (Alco Panel) also Aluminium Composite Material, (ACM) is a type of flat panel that consists of two thin aluminium sheets bonded to a non-aluminium core. ACPs are frequently used for external cladding of buildings (building facades), for insulation and for signage.</p>
 			<p>Alco Panel is mainly used for external and internal architectural cladding or partitions, false ceilings, signage, machine coverings, container construction etc. Applications of Alco Panel are not limited to external building cladding, but can also be used in any form of cladding such as partitions, false ceilings etc.</p>

               <p>Thermal insulation is the reduction of heat transfer (the transfer of thermal energy between objects of differing temperature) between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence. Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials.</p>
 			<p>Maintaining acceptable temperatures in buildings uses a large proportion of global energy consumption. When well insulated, a building saves energy so as money.</p>

               <p>Aluminum is used on a wide variety of applications because it is lightweight and resistant to corrosion, but it tends to be a fairly brittle metal that can break when force is applied in certain ways. Extrusion is a valuable method in the aluminum fabrication process because it generally puts less stress on the metal during the fabrication process as compared to other fabrication methods, meaning the aluminum will be less likely to lose its strength. Aluminum can certainly be fabricated in other ways as well, though other fabrication methods can apply more stress to the metal, thereby making it more brittle as a finished product. </p>
 			<p>Aluminum is often used for window frames, automobile components, bicycle components, building materials such as shuttering form work, and much more.</p>

              <p>Interior Decorating refers to the decorating and furnishing of interior spaces in homes, offices, schools, and public spaces. It deals with all aspects of lighting, color, texture, paint, furniture purchase and placement, flooring selection and installation, fabric installations, window treatments, and accessories. An Interior Decorator is charged with applying or updating the finishes and elements that will be included within a room space.</p>
